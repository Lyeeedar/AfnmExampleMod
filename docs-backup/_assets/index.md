# Asset Types

This section provides guides for creating specific types of content in your mods.

## Coming Soon

This section is currently under development. Asset creation guides will be added here to help you create:

- **Items** - Weapons, armor, treasures, and consumables
- **Techniques** - Combat abilities and special moves
- **Characters** - NPCs with dialogue and interactions
- **Locations** - New areas and environments
- **Quests** - Story content and objectives

For now, refer to the examples in the [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) guide and explore the [Core Concepts](../_concepts/) section.
