# Step 7: Testing & Polish

With all systems implemented, your tea house mod is functionally complete! However, a good mod requires thorough testing, error handling, and quality-of-life improvements. Let's ensure your mod provides a smooth, professional experience for players.

## Comprehensive Testing Strategy

### 1. TypeScript Validation

Always start with static analysis:

```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Or use the getDiagnostics tool in Claude Code
```

**Common TypeScript issues to verify**:
- All interface properties are present and correctly typed
- Item names match exactly between files
- Character names match between definitions and references
- Flag names are consistent across quest steps and events

### 2. System Integration Testing

Test each component in isolation, then together:

#### Item Testing
- Items appear in debug menus/admin commands
- Buffs apply correctly when consuming items
- Stack sizes work as expected
- Rarity colors display properly

#### Character Testing
- Master Chen appears in Liang Tiao Village
- Dialogue interactions work without errors
- Shop only appears after `teaHouseUnlocked == 1`
- Shop stock organized correctly by realm
- Combat stats don't crash if player fights the character

#### Location Testing
- Tea house building appears after quest completion
- Building positioned correctly (`middleright`)
- Brewing interactions consume/create items properly
- Character interactions (talk/trade) function correctly

#### Quest Testing
- First quest triggers when visiting Liang Tiao Village
- Quest steps complete in proper sequence
- Flags are set correctly (`foundTeaHouseClue`, `cleanedTeaHouse`, etc.)
- Second quest only appears after first quest completion
- Quest rewards are delivered properly

#### Event Testing
- Triggered events fire at appropriate times
- Events don't retrigger after flags are set
- Location restrictions work correctly
- Screen targeting functions properly

### 3. Edge Case Testing

#### Resource Scarcity
- What happens if player has no tea leaves for brewing?
- Does the tea house handle empty inventory gracefully?
- Are error messages helpful and clear?

#### Quest State Issues
- What if player fights Master Chen before meeting him peacefully?
- What happens if flags get set out of order?
- Can quests be completed in unexpected sequences?

#### Save/Load Compatibility
- Do global flags persist across game restarts?
- Does the tea house remain unlocked after reloading?
- Are quest states preserved correctly?

## Error Handling and Defensive Programming

### Location Existence Checks

Our current tea brewery code includes defensive programming:

```typescript
export function initializeTeaBrewery() {
  console.log('üçµ Adding tea house to Liang Tiao Village...');

  const liangTiaoVillage = window.modAPI.gameData.locations['Liang Tiao Village'];

  if (liangTiaoVillage) {
    if (!liangTiaoVillage.buildings) {
      liangTiaoVillage.buildings = [];
    }
    liangTiaoVillage.buildings.push(teaHouseBuilding);
    console.log('‚úÖ Added Tea House building to Liang Tiao Village');
  } else {
    console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Liang Tiao Village not found, tea house building created but not linked');
  }
}
```

**Why this matters**: If another mod removes or renames Liang Tiao Village, our mod won't crash the game.

### Item Reference Validation

Consider adding validation to ensure referenced items exist:

```typescript
export function initializeTeaCharacters() {
  console.log('üë§ Adding tea master characters...');

  // Validate that required items exist
  const requiredItems = [greenTeaLeaves.name, jasmineTeaLeaves.name, brewedGreenTea.name];
  const missingItems = requiredItems.filter(itemName =>
    !window.modAPI.gameData.items[itemName]
  );

  if (missingItems.length > 0) {
    console.warn(`‚ö†Ô∏è Missing items for tea characters: ${missingItems.join(', ')}`);
  }

  allTeaCharacters.forEach((character) => {
    window.modAPI.actions.addCharacter(character);
  });

  console.log(`‚úÖ Added ${allTeaCharacters.length} tea characters`);
}
```

### Graceful Degradation

Design systems to work even when components are missing:

```typescript
// In tea house building events
{
  text: 'Talk to Master Chen',
  showCondition: 'teaHouseUnlocked == 1',
  children: [
    {
      kind: 'conditional',
      branches: [
        {
          condition: 'characterExists("Master Chen")',  // Hypothetical check
          children: [
            {
              kind: 'talkToCharacter',
              character: 'Master Chen',
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          condition: '1',  // Fallback
          children: [
            {
              kind: 'text',
              text: 'Master Chen seems to have stepped away momentarily.',
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
}
```

## Quality-of-Life Improvements

### Enhanced Descriptions

Add flavor text that enhances immersion:

```typescript
// Instead of just "You brew tea"
text: 'You carefully steep the green tea leaves in perfectly heated water. The gentle brewing process creates a calming, aromatic tea.',

// Instead of just "Quest complete"
text: 'Master Chen hands you three cups of freshly brewed green tea as a token of gratitude.',
```

### Helpful Player Feedback

Provide clear information about requirements and results:

```typescript
// Clear requirement indication
text: `Brew Green Tea (Requires 3 ${greenTeaLeaves.name})`

// Informative success feedback
text: 'The delicate jasmine flowers release their essence into the hot water, creating a spiritually uplifting brew that enhances one\'s qi awareness.'
```

### Consistent Terminology

Ensure all text uses consistent terms:
- "Tea house" vs "tea house" vs "Tea House"
- "Master Chen" vs "master Chen"
- "Liang Tiao Village" vs "Liang Tiao village"

**Create a style guide** for your mod and follow it consistently.

## Performance Considerations

### Efficient Event Conditions

Use simple conditions when possible:

```typescript
// Efficient
trigger: 'startedTeaHouseQuest == 0'

// Less efficient (but sometimes necessary)
trigger: 'realm >= 3 && questsCompleted >= 5 && hasVisitedLocation("Temple")'
```

### Reasonable Trigger Chances

Don't make triggered events fire too frequently:

```typescript
// Good for quest distribution
triggerChance: 1.0

// Good for rare encounters
triggerChance: 0.1

// Avoid very frequent random events
triggerChance: 0.8  // Too high for random content
```

## Mod Compatibility

### Avoiding Conflicts

**Unique Names**: Ensure all your content has unique identifiers:
```typescript
// Good - clearly mod-prefixed
name: 'Master Chen',
flag: 'teaHouseUnlocked',
quest: 'The Forgotten Tea House'

// Risky - could conflict with other mods
name: 'Merchant',
flag: 'unlocked',
quest: 'Find the House'
```

**Graceful Fallbacks**: Handle missing dependencies:
```typescript
if (!window.modAPI.gameData.locations['Liang Tiao Village']) {
  console.warn('Tea House Mod: Liang Tiao Village not found, creating fallback location reference');
  // Could create alternative quest distribution or skip that content
}
```

### Mod Load Order

Document any dependencies or load order requirements:

```typescript
// At top of index.ts
/**
 * Tea House Mod
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - Base game locations (Liang Tiao Village)
 * - No other mod dependencies
 *
 * Compatible with:
 * - Most other content mods
 * - Location enhancement mods
 *
 * Potential conflicts:
 * - Mods that remove or significantly modify Liang Tiao Village
 * - Mods that use the same character name "Master Chen"
 */
```

## Documentation and User Experience

### Console Logging

Provide clear feedback during mod loading:

```typescript
export function initializeMysticalTeaGarden() {
  console.log('üçµ Initializing Mystical Tea Garden Mod...');
  console.log('üì¶ Version: 1.0.0');
  console.log('üë§ Author: [Your Name]');

  // Detailed progress logging
  initializeTeaItems();       // Logs: "‚úÖ Added 4 tea items"
  initializeTeaCharacters();  // Logs: "‚úÖ Added 1 tea characters"
  initializeTeaBrewery();     // Logs: "‚úÖ Added Tea House building to Liang Tiao Village"
  initializeTeaQuests();      // Logs: "‚úÖ Added 2 tea quests"
  initializeTeaQuestEvents(); // Logs: "‚úÖ Added 2 tea quest triggers"

  console.log('‚úÖ Mystical Tea Garden Mod loaded successfully!');
  console.log('üéØ Visit Liang Tiao Village to begin your tea cultivation journey');
}
```

### Player Instructions

Consider adding in-game guidance:

```typescript
// In first quest trigger event
{
  kind: 'text',
  text: 'As you explore Liang Tiao Village, you notice an old building with a faded sign depicting a tea cup. This could be the start of an interesting discovery...',
}
```
