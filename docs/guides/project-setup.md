# Project Setup

## What We're Building

In this guide, you'll set up a complete modding environment that lets you:

- Write mod code with helpful auto-completion (IntelliSense)
- Automatically build and package your mod
- Test changes quickly without manual file copying

Think of this as setting up a workshop with all the right tools before you start crafting.

## Prerequisites & Installation

### What You Need

Before we begin, you'll need to install a few tools. Don't worry - they're all free and we'll walk through each one.

**Required Tools:**

### 1. Node.js (JavaScript Runtime)

Node.js lets us run the build tools that compile and package your mod.

**Windows Installation:**

1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Click "Download the LTS version" (the green button)
3. Run the downloaded installer (.msi file)
4. **Important:** Check "Add to PATH" during installation (should be default)
5. Restart any open command prompts after installation

**Verify it worked:**

```bash
# Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
node --version
# Should show something like: v18.17.0
```

### 2. Code Editor (VS Code Recommended)

You can use any text editor, but VS Code provides the best experience with auto-completion and error highlighting.

**Windows Installation:**

1. Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download and run the installer
3. During setup, check "Add to PATH" and "Register Code as editor for supported file types"

### 3. Git (Version Control)

Git helps you manage your code changes and download the mod template.

**Windows Installation:**

1. Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Download and run the installer
3. Use default settings (they're fine for our needs)

**Verify it worked:**

```bash
git --version
# Should show something like: git version 2.40.1
```

## Getting the Mod Template

Now that your tools are installed, let's get the starter template for your mod.

### Step 1: Choose Your Approach

You have two options to start your project:

**Option A: Fork on GitHub (Recommended)** _Best if you want to use GitHub for backup and collaboration_

1. **Create a GitHub account** (if you don't have one) at [github.com](https://github.com)
2. **Visit the template:** [AFNM Example Mod repository](https://github.com/Lyeeedar/AfnmExampleMod)
3. **Click "Fork"** (top-right corner) to create your own copy
4. **Clone your fork locally:**
   ```bash
   # Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/AfnmExampleMod.git my-mod-project
   ```

**Option B: Direct Download (Simpler)** _Good for getting started quickly_

1. **Download the template:** Go to the [AFNM Example Mod repository](https://github.com/Lyeeedar/AfnmExampleMod)
2. **Click "Code" ‚Üí "Download ZIP"**
3. **Extract the ZIP** to a folder like `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\my-mod-project`
4. **Open Command Prompt/PowerShell** in that folder and run:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

### Step 2: Open Your Project

1. **Open VS Code**
2. **File ‚Üí Open Folder**
3. **Navigate to and select your mod project folder**

VS Code will open with your project files visible in the sidebar.

### Step 3: Install Project Dependencies

Dependencies are pre-built code libraries that your mod uses (like TypeScript compiler, build tools, etc.).

**In VS Code:**

1. **Open the terminal:** View ‚Üí Terminal (or Ctrl+`)
2. **Run the install command:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

**What this downloads:**

- TypeScript compiler and AFNM type definitions (for auto-completion)
- Build tools (Vite, Rollup) that package your mod
- Development utilities for testing and debugging

**This may take 1-2 minutes.** You'll see a progress indicator as packages download.

**Success indicators:**

- No red error messages
- A new `node_modules/` folder appears in your project
- VS Code shows TypeScript IntelliSense when you open `.ts` files

**Common Issues:**

- **"npm: command not found"** - Node.js wasn't installed correctly. Reinstall and make sure "Add to PATH" is checked.
- **Permission errors on Windows** - Try running VS Code as Administrator, or use PowerShell instead of Command Prompt.

## Personalizing Your Mod

### Step 4: Update Mod Information

Your mod needs a name, description, and author information. This appears in-game and on Steam Workshop.

**Open `package.json`** (in your project root) and find this section:

```json
{
  "name": "my-game-mod",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "A mod for AFNM",
  "author": {
    "name": "<your name>"
  }
}
```

**Update it to something like:**

```json
{
  "name": "mystic-tea-cultivation",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Adds tea-based cultivation techniques and mystical tea gardens to explore",
  "author": {
    "name": "TeaMaster92"
  }
}
```

**Field Guidelines:**

- **name**: Lowercase, use hyphens instead of spaces (this becomes your mod's technical ID)
- **version**: Start with "1.0.0" for your first release
- **description**: 1-2 sentences explaining what your mod adds
- **author.name**: Your modding alias (avoid using your real name for privacy)

### Step 5: Test Your Setup

Let's verify everything is working correctly by building your mod:

**In VS Code terminal, run:**

```bash
# Build your mod package
npm run build
```

**Expected output:**

```
> afnm-example-mod@1.0.0 build
> vite build

‚úì built in 1.23s
```

This command:

- Compiles your TypeScript code
- Bundles your assets
- Creates a packaged mod ready for the game
- Outputs a ZIP file in the `builds/` folder

**If you see errors:** Double-check that you installed Node.js correctly and ran `npm install` without errors.

**Success indicators:**

- No red error messages
- A new `builds/` folder appears
- Inside `builds/` you should see a ZIP file like `my-mod-1.0.0.zip`

## Understanding Your Project

### Project Structure Explained

Here's what each folder and file does in your mod project:

```
your-mod-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modContent/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts              # ‚Üê Your mod code goes here
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/                   # ‚Üê Images, sounds, etc.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ builds/                       # ‚Üê Generated mod packages (appears after build)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                         # ‚Üê This documentation site
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json                  # ‚Üê Mod information and settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json                 # ‚Üê TypeScript compiler settings
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules/                 # ‚Üê Downloaded dependencies (don't edit)
```

**Key files you'll work with:**

- **`src/modContent/index.ts`** - This is where you write your mod logic
- **`src/assets/`** - Put your images, sounds, and other files here
- **`package.json`** - Contains your mod's name, version, and description
- **`builds/`** - Contains packaged mod files ready for the game

**Files you can ignore:**

- **`node_modules/`** - Auto-generated, never edit these files
- **`tsconfig.json`** - Compiler settings, rarely needs changes
- **`docs/`** - The documentation website you're reading now

## Development Workflow

### Essential Commands

Here are the commands you'll use regularly while developing your mod:

```bash
# Install dependencies (run once after downloading template)
npm install

# Build mod package for testing in-game
npm run build

# Clean up generated files (if you need to start fresh)
npm run clean
```

**Important:** Unlike web development, you can't run mods directly with `npm run dev`. You must build your mod and install it in the game to test it.

**Typical workflow:**

1. Edit your mod files in VS Code
2. Run `npm run build` to package your mod
3. Copy the ZIP file from `builds/` to your game's `mods/` folder
4. Restart the game to test your changes
5. Repeat the cycle for iteration

### VS Code Setup Tips

**Recommended Extensions** (VS Code should auto-suggest these):

- **TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features** (built-in, should be enabled)
- **Prettier - Code formatter** (keeps your code neat)

**Useful VS Code features:**

- **Auto-completion:** Type `window.modAPI.` and VS Code shows available functions
- **Error highlighting:** Red squiggly lines show syntax errors
- **Integrated terminal:** View ‚Üí Terminal to run commands without leaving VS Code

### Version Control (Optional but Recommended)

Git helps you track changes and backup your work. Basic workflow:

```bash
# Save your current work
git add .
git commit -m "Added my first tea item"

# Create a branch for new features
git checkout -b feature/tea-garden-location

# Push to GitHub (if you forked the repo)
git push origin main
```

**Or use GitHub Desktop** for a visual interface: [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

**"npm: command not found"**

- Node.js wasn't installed correctly
- Solution: Reinstall Node.js, ensure "Add to PATH" is checked, restart VS Code

**"No TypeScript IntelliSense"**

- VS Code isn't recognizing TypeScript files
- Solution: Open a `.ts` file, then press Ctrl+Shift+P, type "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"

**Build errors about missing files**

- Dependencies weren't installed properly
- Solution: Delete `node_modules/` folder, run `npm install` again

**Permission errors on Windows**

- Windows blocking npm from writing files
- Solution: Run VS Code as Administrator, or use PowerShell instead of Command Prompt
