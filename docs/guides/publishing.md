# Publishing Your Mod

## Introduction

üéâ **Congratulations!** You've created, tested, and polished your AFNM mod. Now it's time to share it with the cultivation community through Steam Workshop. This guide covers the publishing process, optimizing your mod page, and managing updates.

Steam Workshop integration makes it incredibly easy for players to find, install, and automatically update your mods. It's the primary way AFNM players discover new content.

## Before You Publish - Checklist

Make sure your mod is ready for the community:

**Technical Requirements:**

- ‚úÖ Mod builds without errors (`npm run build` works)
- ‚úÖ Tested thoroughly in-game (no crashes, content works as expected)
- ‚úÖ Version number is appropriate (start with "1.0.0" for first release)
- ‚úÖ Package.json has clear name, description, and author info

**Content Quality:**

- ‚úÖ Content is balanced and fits the game's theme
- ‚úÖ Item descriptions and names are polished
- ‚úÖ No placeholder text or debug content
- ‚úÖ Images are appropriate resolution and style

**Community Considerations:**

- ‚úÖ Mod adds meaningful content (not just test items)
- ‚úÖ No copyrighted content from other games/media
- ‚úÖ Content follows the game's mature but not explicit tone

## Steam Workshop Publishing

### Prerequisites

Before you can publish:

**Required:**

- **Steam Account** with Ascend from Nine Mountains in your library
- **Finished Mod** that's been tested and works correctly
- **Built Mod Package** (ZIP file from `npm run build`)

**Important:** You need to own the game on Steam to upload Workshop content, even if you developed the mod elsewhere.

### Getting the Mod Uploader Tool

AFNM provides a dedicated uploader tool that handles Steam Workshop integration:

**Download Location:**

1. Navigate to your forked repository (or the original example mod repo)
2. Look for `/uploader/Mod Uploader 1.0.0 Portable.exe`
3. Download this tool to your computer

### Publishing Process - Step by Step

#### 1. Launch the Uploader

- Run `Mod Uploader 1.0.0 Portable.exe`
- The tool should automatically detect your Steam installation
- If prompted, log into Steam

#### 2. Create New Workshop Entry

- Click **"Upload New Mod"** or similar button
- **Select your mod's ZIP file** from your project's `builds/` folder

#### 3. Configure Workshop Listing

**Essential Fields:**

- **Title:** Usually matches your mod's name from `package.json`
- **Description:** Detailed explanation of what your mod adds (see writing tips below)
- **Preview Image:** Eye-catching screenshot or logo representing your mod
- **Visibility:** Start with "Friends Only" for initial testing, then set to "Public"

**Tags** (select relevant ones):

- Content types: "Items", "Characters", "Locations", "Techniques"
- Themes: "Cultivation", "Tea", "Combat", "Exploration"
- Difficulty: "Beginner Friendly", "Challenging"

#### 4. Upload and Process

- Click **"Upload"** to begin the process
- The uploader packages and sends your content to Steam
- **Wait for completion** - this may take a few minutes depending on your mod size
- Steam will process and validate your submission

#### 5. Workshop Page Finalization

- Once uploaded, Steam automatically creates your Workshop page
- You can edit additional details in Steam's Workshop interface
- Add extra screenshots, detailed changelogs, etc.

### Updating Your Published Mod

When you want to release updates:

1. **Update your mod code** and test the changes
2. **Bump the version** in `package.json` (e.g., "1.0.0" ‚Üí "1.0.1")
3. **Build the updated mod:** `npm run build`
4. **Open the uploader tool**
5. **Select your existing mod** from the list
6. **Choose the new ZIP file**
7. **Click "Update"**

Steam Workshop will automatically notify subscribers and update their local copies.
