# Core Concepts

Understanding these fundamental systems is essential for creating effective AFNM mods. These concepts form the foundation of the game's data-driven architecture.

## Essential Systems

- **[Flags System](flags)** - State management and player progress tracking
- **[Scaling System](scaling)** - Dynamic value calculations and balance
- **[Mod API](modapi)** - The API that provides access to core game features to your mod

These systems power most of the game's mechanics, from simple item effects to complex quest chains and character progression. Master these concepts, and you'll be able to create sophisticated, balanced content that integrates seamlessly with the base game.
