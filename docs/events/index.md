# Events System

The events system is the heart of interactive content in Ascend from Nine Mountains. Whether you're creating dialogue with NPCs, managing complex storylines, or building dynamic encounters, events provide the foundation for all interactive experiences.

## Learning Path

**New to events?** Follow this recommended progression:

1. **[Events](events)** - Start here to understand the core event system and structure
2. **[Event Steps](event-steps)** - Learn about the building blocks that make up events
3. **[Event Step Types](steps/)** - Reference for specific step types as needed
4. **[Triggered Events](triggered-events)** - Advanced automatic event triggering
5. **[Calendar Events](calendar-events)** - Time-based seasonal and festival events

**Estimated Time:** 45-60 minutes to complete the full sequence

## Core Components

- **[Events](events)** - The main event system and structure
- **[Event Steps](event-steps)** - Individual actions that make up events
- **[Event Step Types](steps/)** - Complete reference for all step types
- **[Triggered Events](triggered-events)** - Automatic event triggering system
- **[Calendar Events](calendar-events)** - Time-based seasonal and festival events

## What You Can Create

Events enable you to build rich, interactive content including:

- **Character conversations and dialogue trees** - Multi-branched conversations with meaningful choices
- **Complex storylines with branching narratives** - Player decisions that affect story outcomes
- **Quest systems and progression tracking** - Structured progression with rewards and consequences
- **Item interactions and world changes** - Items that trigger events and modify game state
- **Combat encounters and crafting challenges** - Interactive challenges beyond basic mechanics
- **Location-based events and discoveries** - Content that responds to where players are

## Prerequisites

Before diving into events, ensure you're familiar with:

- **[Mod Development Basics](../guides/mod-development)** - Understanding the ModAPI
- **[Flags System](../concepts/flags)** - Events rely heavily on flags for conditions and state tracking
- **[Game Data Structure](../concepts/game-data)** - How the game organizes characters, locations, and items

The system is designed to be both powerful and approachable, allowing you to create everything from simple item interactions to complex, multi-branched storylines that respond to player choices and game state.
