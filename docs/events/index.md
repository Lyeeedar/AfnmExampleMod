# Events System

The events system is the heart of interactive content in Ascend from Nine Mountains. Whether you're creating dialogue with NPCs, managing complex storylines, or building dynamic encounters, events provide the foundation for all interactive experiences.

## Core Components

- **[Events](events)** - The main event system and structure
- **[Event Steps](event-steps)** - Individual actions that make up events  
- **[Event Step Types](steps/)** - Complete reference for all step types
- **[Triggered Events](triggered-events)** - Automatic event triggering system

## What You Can Create

Events enable you to build rich, interactive content including:

- Character conversations and dialogue trees
- Complex storylines with branching narratives  
- Quest systems and progression tracking
- Item interactions and world changes
- Combat encounters and crafting challenges
- Location-based events and discoveries

The system is designed to be both powerful and approachable, allowing you to create everything from simple item interactions to complex, multi-branched storylines that respond to player choices and game state.
